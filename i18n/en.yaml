- id: index_info2_title
  translation: "Far more affordable"

- id: index_info2_content
  translation: "Sia's decentralized cloud is on average 10x less expensive than current cloud storage providers. Storing 1TB on Sia costs about $2 per month, compared with $23 on Amazon S3. Calculate your savings below!"

- id: index_info3_title
  translation: "Highly redundant"

- id: index_info3_content
  translation: "Sia stores tiny pieces of your files on dozens of nodes across the globe. This eliminates any single point of failure and ensures highest possible uptime, on par with other cloud storage providers."

- id: index_info4_title
  translation: "Open Source"

- id: index_info4_content

- id: index_info5_title
  translation: "Built on blockchain"

- id: index_info5_content

### paragraphs ###
- id: about_p1
  translation: "The idea of Sia was originally conceived at HackMIT 2013. What if you could liberate the unused storage space of the world and unite it into a worldwide free market for data?"

- id: about_p2
  translation: "Sia leverages the capacity of blockchain technology to enable distributed networks to reach consensus in a secure and trustless way. Cryptographically secured smart contracts ensure the encryption and transfer of data with no possibility for a third party to interfere in any way."

- id: about_p3
  translation: "Sia is a new approach to cloud storage platforms. Instead of all datacenters being owned and operated by a single company, Sia opens the floodgates and allows anyone to make money by renting out their hard drive. Data integrity is protected using redundancy and cryptography."

- id: about_p4
  translation: "The promise of Sia is a decentralized network of datacenters that, taken together, comprise the world's fastest, cheapest, and most secure cloud storage platform. Today, being a major cloud storage player requires having datacenters, building trust within the market, reaching customers, and competing with giants such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft."

- id: about_p5
  translation: "Breaking into this market is a multi-billion dollar endeavor. The long term goal of Sia is to be the backbone storage layer of the Internet."

- id: about_p6
  translation: "We believe data should be free. We aim to liberate the unused bits of the world and construct the largest storage superserver on the planet."

# URL: /lts.html
- id: lts_explanation1
  translation: "Sia has a special line of releases called the Long Term Support releases. LTS releases most notably do not include new features until those features have been in production for a long time without revealing any new or unexpected bugs. This means that important features (such as instant wallet unlocking) do not make it into an LTS release until several months after they are released to the general public."

- id: lts_explanation2
  translation: "All Sia releases are thoroughly tested. However, the reality is that bugs do make it into production. It is our goal that none of our releases have bugs, but until we are able to consistently achieve that goal we provide the more slowly-upgrading LTS releases for users and developers who require stability. Unless stability is critical, we recommend using our <a href=\"../apps\">production releases</a>, which are generally faster, more user-friendly, and more featureful."

### faqs ###

- id: faq_sia1q
  translation: "What is Sia?"
- id: faq_sia1a
  translation: "Sia is a decentralized cloud storage platform that uses a blockchain to facilitate payments. On Sia you can rent storage, get paid host files, mine Siacon, or contribute to the project!"

- id: faq_sia2q
  translation: "Why Sia?"
- id: faq_sia2a
  translation: "Existing cloud storage providers are centralized. Costs are high, data is often unencrypted, and each provider typically runs only several large data centers. Sia, by contrast, allows for private, decentralized, distributed cloud storage at a far lower price."

- id: faq_sia3q
  translation: "What’s a Siacoin?"
- id: faq_sia3a
  translation: "Sia uses a cryptocurrency, Siacoin, to enable decentralized payments via file contracts. All payments on the network happen in Siacoin, which is a critical component of our cryptographic SLAs. Siacoin allows us to do things that would not be possible with Bitcoin or traditional online payments."

- id: faq_sia4q
  translation: "Can I contribute, or build on Sia?"
- id: faq_sia4a
  translation: "Yes! We would love that. All of Sia's code is 100% open sourced and can be found on our <a href=\"https://github.com/NebulousLabs\">Github</a>."

- id: faq_sia5q
  translation: "Who created Sia?"
- id: faq_sia5a
  translation: "Sia was created by David Vorick and Luke Champine of Nebulous Inc, a VC-funded startup in Boston. Learn more about the team and company <a href=\"https://sia.tech/about\">here</a>."
